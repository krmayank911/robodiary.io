<p6>These Boards are simply Arduino microcontroller on a breadboard, the circuit is just etched on a PCB.
 They work just fine as the original Arduino boards if proper circuitry is used.</p6>

This board that we have developed uses an ATmega328P IC, 
a L293D motor driver IC connected to its PWM pins and a 7805 voltage regulator to supply 5V regulated voltage.
Other pins are left alone for different other different tasks. This board can also be used with other different shields.

This board can be programmed through another Arduino board using Its Tx-Rx pins.
 Also for this purpose other modes of programing can be used.
 ISP (In System Programming) is the other common mode of programming.
 <br>
 In system programming can be used through another 
 Arduino microcontroller using Arduino as ISP or through a ASP programmer.
