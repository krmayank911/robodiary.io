title: Soil Moisture Sensor
meta: A sensor that measures the moisture in the soil.
---

<p6>Soil moisture sensor is used to measure the water content in soil. The soil moisture sensor uses 
capacitance to measure the dielectric permitivity of the surrounding medium.
<br>
In soil, dielectric permitivity is a function of water content.The sensor creates a small voltage
proportional to the dielectric permitivity of soil. This small analog voltage signal is fed to 
microcontroller to process and to calculate the water content in soil.
